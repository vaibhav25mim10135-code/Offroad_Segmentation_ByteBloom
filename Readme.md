Duality AI: Offroad Semantic Scene Segmentation

A robust semantic segmentation pipeline designed for unstructured off-road environments. This project leverages a frozen DINOv2 (Vision Transformer) backbone for rich feature extraction and a lightweight ConvNeXt-style head for efficient pixel-wise classification.
🌟 Features

    10 Terrain Classes: Specialized for off-road navigation (Trees, Bushes, Logs, Rocks, etc.).

    Modern Backbone: Utilizes DINOv2 ViT-S/14 for state-of-the-art visual features.

    Efficient Decoding: Lightweight ConvNeXt-style segmentation head.

    Comprehensive Evaluation: Automated generation of mIoU, Dice Score, and Pixel Accuracy.

    Visual Output: Side-by-side comparisons of Input vs. Ground Truth vs. Predicted Masks.
